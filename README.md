# XYZ Shop Management System

This Java project implements a shop management system, allowing customers to browse items, place orders, and view invoices. Sellers can add and remove products, and track their sales. The system also includes an admin role for user management and product approval.

## Key Features:

### Object-Oriented Design:
 Utilizes inheritance and polymorphism for code reusability and maintainability.
### User Management: 
Handles registration, login, and different user roles (customer, seller, admin).
### Product Catalog: 
Allows sellers to add and manage products, and customers to view available items.
### Order Processing: Enables customers to create, view, and delete orders.
### File Storage: 
Saves and loads user and product data to/from text files for persistence.
### Exception Handling: 
Includes basic error handling and input validation to improve robustness.

This project was completed as a collaborative college assignment, demonstrating our understanding of OOP principles and Java programming.
